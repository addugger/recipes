1 Package Velveta Mexican Cheese
1-2 lbs (don't really remember, but it probably doesn't matter too much) chorizo sausage
1 can diced tomatoes (not strained)

Easiest and most delicious thing ever.

Cook the sausage in a pan as you regularly would.

Melt the "cheese" in the microwave.

Put everthing in a crock pot, turn it on, and mix it up.

Once crock pot has gotten hot enough to keep the cheese melted and whatnot, you're done.

That's it!

Stop reading and go make it dang it!
